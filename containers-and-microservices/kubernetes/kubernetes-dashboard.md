# Kubernetes Dashboard

* Default GUI for 'upstream' Kubernetes - [https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard)
* Some distributions have their own GUI - Rancher, Docker Enterprise, OpenShift
* Clouds \(like EKS\) don't have it by default
* Safety first! Dashboards must be secure and with restricted access and authentication
