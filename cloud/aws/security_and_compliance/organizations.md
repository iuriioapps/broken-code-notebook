# Organizations

Organizations allow you to manage multiple AWS accounts at once. With Organizations, you can create groups of accounts and then apply policies to those groups.

* **Control access** - with organizations you can create **Service Control Policies \(SCPs\)** that centrally control AWS service use across multiple AWS accounts.
* **Automate AWS account creation** - you can use AWS Organizations APIs to automate the creation and management of new AWS accounts. The Organizations APIs enable you to create new accounts programmatically, and to add the new accounts to a group. The policies attached to the group are automatically applied to the new account.
* **Consolidated billing** - AWS Organizations enables you to setup a single payment method for all the AWS accounts in your organization through consolidated billing. With consolidated billing you can see a combined view of charges incurred by all your accounts, as well as take advantage of pricing benefits from aggregated usage, such as volume discounts for EC2 and S3.
