# DDOS

* A Distributed Denial Of Service \(DDOS\) attack is an attack that attempts to make your website or application unavailable to end users. This can be achieved by multiple mechanisms, such as large packet floods, by using a combination of reflection and amplification, or by using large botnets.

How to mitigate DDOS

* Minimize the attack surface area
* Be ready to scale to absorb the attack
* Safeguard exposed resources
* Learn normal behavior
* Create a plan for attack
