# EFS

Amazon EFS is a file storage service for EC2 instances. EFS is easy to use and provides simple interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily. With EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add or remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.

* Supports the Network File System v4 protocol \(NFSv4\).
* You only pay for the storage you use \(no pre-provisioning required\).
* Can scale up to the petabytes.
* Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections.
* Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region.
* Read after write consistency.
