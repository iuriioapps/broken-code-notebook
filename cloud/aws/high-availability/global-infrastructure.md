# Global Infrastructure

The AWS Global Infrastructure builds around **Regions** and **Availability Zones**. So far, there are:

* 65 availability zones
* 22 geographic regions
* 1 local region

### Regions

Regions provide physically separated availability zones, which are connected with low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking.

### Availability Zones

Availability Zones offer high availability, fault tolerance and scalability.

* Consists of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
* An availability zone is represented by a region code followed by a letter identifier, for example - `us-east-1a`
* Local region is a single data center designated to compliment an existing AWS region
* Edge locations are locations where end users access services located at AWS.
